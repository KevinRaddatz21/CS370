**CS370: Current/Emerging Trends in CS**

**Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**
For this project, I was given the code for the neural network as well as some base functions to work with (GameExperience and TreasureMaze classes). The code I had to write was the training algorithm. This then trained the network to be able to identify the correct path for the agent to the goal. 


**Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**
Computer scientists use computers and software to problem solve. Solving problems is essentially the core of this profession. This matters because it can lead to groundbreaking technology and can change the day to day lives of people if done correctly. 

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**
As a computer scientist, you have to approcach problems thinking about how you can solve them most efficiently. It is also important to remember to do things ethically and responsibly. It is also important to 'modularize' problems so you are not looking at it all as one huge mountain. 

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**
As a computer scientist, you have an ethical resposibility to the end user/organization that you work for to do your best work, do no harm to anything, act in a way that is in compliance with all Laws and professional codes of ethics.
